This repository demonstrates a common Python error: an unclosed parenthesis in a function definition. The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` provides the corrected version.  This simple example showcases how a seemingly minor syntax error can lead to a significant runtime problem. The solution involves carefully reviewing code for balanced parentheses and other syntax elements.
